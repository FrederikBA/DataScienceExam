# IMDb Top 1000 Movies Analysis and Recommendation System

## Stage 1: Problem Definition

### A. Idea and concept:

### Challenge
Analyze the IMDb Top 1000 movies dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships between various movie features, and develop a movie recommendation system based on the findings. The main focus will be on natural language processing methods such as sentiment analysis and embedding.

### Importance
Understanding the characteristics of highly-rated movies can provide insights for the movie industry and help movie enthusiasts discover new films based on their preferences. The movie recommender can easily be ported to any brand with similar features to recommend any product based on a text input.

### Expected Solution
1. A comprehensive analysis of the IMDb Top 1000 movies dataset, including visualizations and statistical analysis. The AI models we will develop are:

2. A recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences and movie features.
Sentiment analysis on movie reviews

3. A classifier to predict expected earnings of a new movie. The model will use features such as rating, runtime, release year to predict the earnings.


### Impact
The solution could benefit movie industry professionals by providing insights into successful movies, and movie enthusiasts by offering personalized movie recommendations.


### B. Project Information:

## Title
IMDb Top 1000 Movies Analysis and Recommendation System

## Workflow
The project will be worked on over four 1-week sprints. Here each member will work individually and together on various tasks. Each week has a different focus point in the following order: (Problem Definition, Data Preparation, AI Solution Prototype and Visualizations)

## Stack
The solution will be a client / server solution with a back- and frontend. We will also be utilizing Jupyter Notebooks for certain tasks. Each AI model will be developed in a notebook where the model will be saved for further use in the client/server solution. The backend server is programmed in Python using FastAPI. The frontend is a React SPA.

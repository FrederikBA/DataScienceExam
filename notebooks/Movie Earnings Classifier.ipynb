    "# Movie Gross Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore using a decision tree classifier to predict movie gross. We will explore where certain factors and features in the movie can be used to see how much a movie with manually selected features can expect to earn. This model is trained on top 1000 highest grossing movie data updated in january 2023. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "This task involves training an AI model on the provided movie dataset to learn patterns and make predictions on unseen movies. The decision tree classifier will use and base its predictions on features such as genre, runtime, rating etc to determine the predicted gross earnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will be built to predict the page a new movie will land at. Page 1 means the movie is top 100 and Page 10 means the movie will be top 1000. Each page will have an average gross across the 100 movies and this is the amount of money we will estimate the prediction to earn\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries\n",
    "For this notebook we will require the following python libraries and imports"
